#Kailey Conrad 8/13/2023
#Purpose: Create a text-based game where the player has to pick up 7 items before encountering Hades to win - if they meet him before hand, they lose.
#Self-Note: Create discriptions of rooms and their discriptions as well as items and their descriptions at later date.
    #Perhaps also give user more guidance as to what directions will work and when.

#Goals with rework:
    #Accept  broader inputs to make input less clunky w/ directions - DONE
    #Add descriptions for items - working
    #Add descriptions for rooms - working
    #Add more to failed ending
    #Add more to success ending - working
        #Add player's choice of reincarnation with or without knowing who they were before they died. - working
